# name-coding
TODO: documentation

## Problem Statement
Create a command line utility that will compute a score for a list of first names.
The list of names will be provided as a text file. The full path to the names file will be specified as a command line argument. The names file will contain a single line of quoted, comma-separated names. A small sample of data can be found at the end of this document and a full sample file (names.txt) is attached.
To score a list of names, you must sort it alphabetically and sum the individual scores for all the names. To score a name, sum the alphabetical value of each letter (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc...) and multiply the sum by the nameâ€™s position in the list (1-based).

For example, when the sample data below is sorted into alphabetical order, LINDA, which is worth 12 + 9 + 14 + 4 + 1 = 40, is the 4th name in the list. So, LINDA would obtain a score of 40 x 4 = 160. The correct score for the entire list is 3194

```
"MARY","PATRICIA","LINDA","BARBARA","VINCENZO","SHON","LYNWOOD","JERE","HAI"
```
